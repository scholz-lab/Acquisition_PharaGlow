# Acquisition_PharaGlow
LabVIEW code for acquisition of PharaGlow data

The code has been used in combination with the BASLER camera model acA3088-57um. For the program to work, the appropiate drivers need to be used for the camera (NI-IMAQdx USB3 Vision). The installation of the drivers can be done using the NI MAX software. Using NI MAX, it should be possible to grab pictures to test that the camera is available. The camera number should also be displayed in NI MAX. Note that upon replacement of the drivers, the camera will not be anymore available using the pylon viewer. The old drivers can be restored using NI MAX. As a side note, in several occasions, restoring the appropiate driver could not be achieved with MAX and all associated drivers need to be reinstalled.
